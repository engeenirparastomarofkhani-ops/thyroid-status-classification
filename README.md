# Thyroid Status Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning approach for classifying thyroid status using clinical laboratory data.

## Features
- TSH
- FT4
- FT3

## Model
- Decision Tree Classifier (scikit-learn)

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess clinical data
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train a Decision Tree model
4. Evaluate model accuracy
5. Predict thyroid status for new patient data

## Example Prediction
The model can predict thyroid status for unseen lab values such as:
- TSH = 1.2
- FT4 = 1.1
- FT3 = 3.0

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset created for educational and demonstration purposes.
It does not represent real patient data.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation metrics
- Visualization and explainability
